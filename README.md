[Project] General Explanations

I think you all know what is Role Play. It's basically a game you play with some friends. You create a character, and play like you were this character. To govern the game, there is a game master. He'll tell the story according to the choices you'll do. Sometimes there are some dices to do some actions. Like, if you want to attack a monster, you need to roll the dices, and see how much damages you do to the monster. There is more rules, like the "Fails" or other things.

Today, the heritage of Role Play is Role Play Game (RPG) and Massive Multiplayer Online Role Play Game (MMORPG). There are today plenty RPG and MMORPG, WoW, Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy and many others. They are famous, millions of people have played these games, and billions have heard of them. But, the traditionnal Role Play isn't really present in the vidéo game industry. I've played at one "Knights of pen and paper", but I was not able to find another game like this.

So my project is to create a game that take the base of the IRL role play with dices and adapt it to be a RPG like we know today, but with a bit more strategy (I know this isn't very precise but…I don't really know how to explain ahah !). I've already a little program with the essence of the game that I'd like to create.

In this game you'll be the role player, the game master will told you the story and you'll act as you want with the character you'll create. 
The thing that will change with classic turn-by-turn RPG is that you'll need luck. Indeed they'll be a big RNG part in the game, like in Role Play.

Here the general explanation of the project. More precise details in the [General] category.
